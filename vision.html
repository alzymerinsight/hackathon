        <!-- Music Therapy Section -->
        <section id="music-therapy">
            <h2>Music Therapy</h2>
            <p>Music therapy is a non-pharmacological intervention that utilizes music to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs of individuals. It has been shown to be particularly beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
            Research indicates that music has a unique ability to stimulate various areas of the brain, evoke memories, and enhance overall well-being. In individuals with Alzheimer's, music therapy can help reduce agitation, improve mood, decrease anxiety, and increase social engagement.
            Alzymer Insight's music therapy section provides a wide range of curated playlists and music therapy sessions designed specifically for individuals with Alzheimer's. These playlists encompass various genres, tempos, and styles to cater to diverse preferences and needs.
            Users can explore playlists tailored to different stages of the disease, from early to advanced, with each playlist carefully curated to evoke positive emotions, trigger memories, and promote relaxation. Additionally, interactive music therapy sessions are available, allowing users to actively participate in therapeutic musical activities.
            By incorporating music therapy into daily routines, individuals with Alzheimer's and their caregivers can experience the transformative power of music in improving quality of life, enhancing communication, and fostering meaningful connections.
            Moreover, recent studies have shown that music therapy may also have neuroprotective effects, slowing down cognitive decline and preserving cognitive function in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. This underscores the importance of integrating music therapy into comprehensive care plans for individuals affected by the disease.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Prediction Tools Section -->
        <section id="prediction-tools">
            <h2>Prediction Tools</h2>
            <p>Early detection and intervention are crucial in effectively managing Alzheimer's disease. Prediction tools play a vital role in assessing an individual's risk of developing the condition, allowing for timely interventions and personalized care plans.
            Alzymer Insight's prediction tools utilize advanced algorithms and data analysis techniques to assess various risk factors associated with Alzheimer's disease. These tools may include online quizzes, surveys, and cognitive assessments designed to evaluate cognitive function, lifestyle factors, genetic predisposition, and other relevant indicators.
            By completing these prediction tools, individuals can gain valuable insights into their cognitive health and identify potential risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. Early detection of risk factors enables individuals to take proactive steps towards prevention, such as adopting a healthy lifestyle, engaging in cognitive exercises, and seeking medical evaluation.
            Furthermore, prediction tools can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's, facilitating targeted interventions, and providing appropriate support and resources to patients and their families.
            Alzymer Insight is committed to empowering individuals with knowledge and resources to take control of their cognitive health and reduce the burden of Alzheimer's disease through early detection and intervention.
            Additionally, ongoing research is focused on refining prediction models and identifying novel biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease, with the goal of enhancing the accuracy and reliability of prediction tools. By staying at the forefront of scientific advancements, Alzymer Insight aims to continuously improve prediction tools and support early detection efforts.</p>
